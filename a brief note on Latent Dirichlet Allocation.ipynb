    "to begin with, we need to understand dirichlet distribution. Actually, it's kind of like a distribution of parameters of another multinomial distribution. It measures the probability of probabilities.\n",

    "5) Count the topics of each word in each document in the corpus to obtain the document topic distribution $\\theta_d$, and count the distribution of each topic word in the corpus to obtain the LDA topic and word distribution $\\beta_k$ \n",
